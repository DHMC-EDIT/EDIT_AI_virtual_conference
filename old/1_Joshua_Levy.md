**Abstract:** Vast quantities of electronic patient medical data are currently being collated and processed in large federated data repositories. For instance, TriNetX, Inc., a global health research network, has access to more than 300 million patients, sourced from healthcare organizations, biopharmaceutical companies, and contract research organizations. As such, pipelines that are able to algorithmically extract huge quantities of patient data from multiple modalities present opportunities to leverage machine learning and deep learning approaches with the possibility of generating actionable insight. In this work, we present a modular, semi-automated end-to-end machine and deep learning pipeline designed to interface with a federated network of structured patient data. This proof-of-concept pipeline is disease-agnostic, scalable, and requires little domain expertise and manual feature engineering in order to quickly produce results for the case of a user-defined binary outcome event. We demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy with three different disease workflows, with high discriminatory power achieved in all cases.
