abstract: Vast quantities of electronic patient medical data are currently being collated and processed in large federated data repositories. For instance, TriNetX, Inc., a global health research network, has access to more than 300 million patients, sourced from healthcare organizations, biopharmaceutical companies, and contract research organizations. As such, pipelines that are able to algorithmically extract huge quantities of patient data from multiple modalities present opportunities to leverage machine learning and deep learning approaches with the possibility of generating actionable insight. In this work, we present a modular, semi-automated end-to-end machine and deep learning pipeline designed to interface with a federated network of structured patient data. This proof-of-concept pipeline is disease-agnostic, scalable, and requires little domain expertise and manual feature engineering in order to quickly produce results for the case of a user-defined binary outcome event. We demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy with three different disease workflows, with high discriminatory power achieved in all cases.

## Shameless plug of Levy Lab website, taken from lab website:

#### Members of the Levy Lab develop biomedical technologies that solve big data problems with the stakeholder in mind. Developed technologies undergo a "technology and stakeholder readiness stress test" that considers the algorithmic and adoptability aspects prior to further validation.

The Levy Lab aspires to foster interdisciplinary collaboration amongst basic and physician science researchers in order to inform our understanding of disease processes while considering pragmatic barriers to implementation and dissemination of findings. Their translational work informs basic science research through reverse translation studies.

Students in the Levy Lab have opportunities to spearhead multiple projects while interfacing directly with clinicians and will be exposed to a blend of interdisciplinary research perspectives.
